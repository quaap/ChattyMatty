# ChattyMatty

A small security-less chat program for local networks.

I wrote this for my family's local network. 

Build to a jar: either run `ant` or use Netbeans

Copy the jar to each computer, and run by double clicking, or run `java -jar ChattyMatty.jar`.  

One person arbitrarily chooses to be a server and everyone else puts in that person's IP/hostname.  


You can also put the jar in your computer's startup programs. 

I've tested on Windows and Linux, but it should work on any platform with Java 1.7+ installed.


//There is no security.//
