# ChattyMatty

A small security-less chat program for local networks

I wrote this for my family's local network. 

Build to a jar: either run `ant` or use Netbeans

Copy the jar to each computer, and run by double clicking, or run `java -jar ChattyMatty.jar`  One person arbitrarily chooses to be a server and everyone else puts in that person's IP/hostname.  

//There is no security.//
